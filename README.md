# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLO12

This repository contains a real-time object detection implementation using YOLO12. The project leverages the latest advancements in deep learning to achieve efficient and accurate object detection.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLO12
- Trained on the COCO dataset
- Supports video and live camera feed input
- Configurable via `coco.yml`

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikhilPatil0007/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## Usage

Run the object detection script:
```bash
python Real_time_object_detection_YOLOv12.ipynb
```

## Configuration

Modify the `coco.yml` file to adjust detection settings such as confidence thresholds, model paths, and class labels.
